      MLKVM validation using GLUE NER task on Lithuanian dataset

    longDescription: >
      This repository contains scripts for MLKVM validation using GLUE NER task on Lithuanian dataset.
      It provides a complete pipeline for preparing data, fine-tuning, and evaluating Named Entity 
      Recognition (NER) model in Lithuanian language, following GLUE-style evaluation methodology. The
      repository uses the neurotechnology/BLKT-ModernBert-MLM-Stage3-RC1 model as the base encoder and 
      the Lithuanian subset of the MultiLeg-dataset (https://github.com/tilde-nlp/MultiLeg-dataset/tree/main/data/lt)
      for training and evaluation. It includes tools for converting the dataset from JSONL to CoNLL format, 
      fine-tuning the model, and computing token- and entity-level metrics such as precision, recall, 
      and F1 scores (including exact, overlap, and union matches).
