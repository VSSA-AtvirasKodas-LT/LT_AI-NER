    shortDescription: MLKVM validation using the GLUE NER task on a Lithuanian dataset
    longDescription: This repository contains scripts for MLKVM validation using the
      GLUE NER task on a Lithuanian dataset. It provides a complete pipeline for
      preparing data, fine-tuning, and evaluating the Named Entity Recognition
      (NER) model in the Lithuanian language, following the GLUE-style
      evaluation methodology. The repository uses the
      neurotechnology/BLKT-ModernBert-MLM-Stage3-RC1 model as the base encoder
      and the Lithuanian subset of the MultiLeg-dataset
      (https://github.com/tilde-nlp/MultiLeg-dataset/tree/main/data/lt) for
      training and evaluation. It includes tools for converting the dataset from
      JSONL to CoNLL format, fine-tuning the model, and computing tokens and
      entity-level metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 scores (including
      exact, overlap, and union matches).
